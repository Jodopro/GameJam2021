set up virtual environment:\
`python3.8 -m virtualenv venv` (if python3.8 is not installed, most other versions of python >= 3.6 should work)


activate virtual environment:\
`. ./venv/bin/activate` on ubuntu \
`.\venv\Scripts\active` for windows


and subsequently install the requirements:\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then, to run, move into the src directory:\
`cd src`\
and then run main.py:\
`python main.py`
