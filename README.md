if you don't have virtualenv installed, you can install it by running:\
`pip install virtualenv`\
set up virtual environment:\
`python -m virtualenv venv` (make sure you are using python >= 3.6)

activate virtual environment:\
`. ./venv/bin/activate` on ubuntu \
`source ./venv/Scripts/activate` for windows


and subsequently install the requirements:\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then, move into the src directory:\
